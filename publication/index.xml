      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study of software transparency has deep roots in software engineering, a shared definition and practical application in real-world development contexts remain elusive. Through an in-depth analysis of the academic and industrial landscape, this article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on software transparency, outlining a path to a deeper understanding of the subject for both developers and researchers. The challenge of software transparency involves not only establishing a formal, widely accepted understanding within the community, but also measuring and quantifying it in production environments. To this end, we survey academics and developers to evaluate an innovative approach to defining transparency and present a vision of a new framework for its quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/ast2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of the microservice architectural style has led to a growing demand for automated testing approaches tailored to these systems. EvoMaster is a state-of-the-art tool that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically generate test cases for microservices’ REST APIs. One limitation of these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch distances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively capture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level testing. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH) that uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation process. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by learning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different microservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation of the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case based on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically evaluate MISH’s effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice applications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for testing REST APIs. Our evaluation shows promising results for using MISH to guide the automated test case generation within EvoMaster&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRVN is a regression testing tool that aims to diversify the test scenarios (road maps) to execute for testing and validating self-driving cars. DRVN harnesses the power of convolutional neural networks to identify possible failing roads in a set of generated examples before applying a greedy algorithm that selects and prioritizes the most diverse roads during regression testing. Initial testing discovered that DRVN performed well against random-based test selection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rocket: A System-Level Fuzz-Testing Framework for the XRPL Consensus Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/icst2025-tool/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms are critical for achieving consistency and reliability in distributed systems, especially in the presence of faults or adversarial behavior. The consensus algorithm used by the XRP Ledger falls into this category. In practice, the implementation of these algorithms is prone to errors, which can lead to undesired behavior in the system. This paper introduces Rocket, a fuzz-testing framework designed for the XRPL consensus algorithm. Rocket enables researchers and developers to automatically inject network and process faults into a locally simulated network of XRPL validator nodes to test if the system behaves as expected. This technique has previously been shown to be effective in finding implementation errors. Rocket has been designed to focus on extensibility and ease of use, enabling users to run complex test scenarios with minimal setup.

      <title>CATMA: Conformance Analysis Tool For Microservice Applications</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/icse2024-tool/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microservice architecture allows developers to divide the core functionality of their software system into multiple smaller services. However, this architectural style also makes it harder for them to debug and assess whether the system&amp;rsquo;s deployment conforms to its implementation. We present CATMA, an automated tool that detects non-conformances between the system&amp;rsquo;s deployment and implementation. It automatically visualizes and generates potential interpretations for the detected discrepancies. Our evaluation of CATMA shows promising results in terms of performance and providing useful insights. CATMA is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cyber-analytics.nl/catma.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://cyber-analytics.nl/catma.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;, and a demonstration video is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/WKP1hG-TDKc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/WKP1hG-TDKc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TestSpark: IntelliJ IDEA’s Ultimate Test Generation Companion</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/icse2024-tool2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 19:37:11 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing software tests is laborious and time-consuming. To address
this, prior studies introduced various automated test-generation
techniques. A well-explored research direction in this field is unit
test generation, wherein artificial intelligence (AI) techniques create
tests for a method/class under test. While many of these techniques
have primarily found applications in a research context, existing
tools (e.g., EvoSuite, Randoop, and AthenaTest) are not user-friendly
and are tailored to a single technique. This paper introduces Test-
Spark, a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that enables users to generate unit
tests with only a few clicks directly within their Integrated De-
velopment Environment (IDE). Furthermore, TestSpark also allows
users to easily modify and run each generated test and integrate
them into the project workflow. TestSpark leverages the advances of
search-based test generation tools, and it introduces a technique to
generate unit tests using Large Language Models (LLMs) by creating
a feedback cycle between the IDE and the LLM. Since TestSpark is
an open-source (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/TestSpark%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/TestSpark)&lt;/a&gt;,
extendable, and well-documented tool, it is possible to add new test
generation methods into the plugin with the minimum effort. This
paper also explains our future studies related to TestSpark and our
preliminary results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking the Silence: the Threats of Using LLMs in Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/icse-nier2024/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained considerable traction within the Software Engineering (SE) community, impacting various SE tasks from code completion to test generation, from program repair to code summarization. Despite their promise, researchers must still be careful as numerous intricate factors can influence the outcomes of experiments involving LLMs.
This paper initiates an open discussion on potential threats to the validity of LLM-based research including issues such as closed-source models, possible data leakage between LLM training data and research evaluation, and the reproducibility of LLM-based findings.
In response, this paper proposes a set of guidelines tailored for SE researchers and Language Model (LM) providers to mitigate these concerns.
The implications of the guidelines are illustrated using existing good practices followed by LLM providers and a practical example for SE researchers in the context of test case generation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-objective Black-Box Test Case Prioritization Based on Wordnet Distances</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/ssbse-nier2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 09:16:23 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test case prioritization techniques have emerged as effective strategies to optimize this process and mitigate the regression testing costs. Commonly, black-box heuristics guide optimal test ordering, leveraging information retrieval (e.g., cosine distance) to measure the test case distance and sort them accordingly. However, a challenge arises when dealing with tests of varying granularity levels, as they may employ distinct vocabularies (e.g., name identifiers). In this paper, we propose to measure the distance between test cases based on the shortest path between their identifiers within the WordNet lexical database. This additional heuristic is combined with the traditional cosine distance to prioritize test cases in a multi-objective fashion. Our preliminary study conducted with two different Java projects shows that test cases prioritized with WordNet achieve larger fault detection capability (APFD) compared to the traditional cosine distance used in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://example.com/publication/ieee-tse2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Search-based approaches have been used in the literature to automate the process of creating unit test cases. However, related work has shown that generated tests with high code coverage could be ineffective, i.e., they may not detect all faults or kill all injected mutants. In this paper, we propose CLING, an integration-level test case generation approach that exploits how a pair of classes, the caller and the callee, interact with each other through method calls. In particular, CLING generates integration-level test cases that maximize the Coupled Branches Criterion (CBC). Coupled branches are pairs of branches containing a branch of the caller and a branch of the callee such that an integration test that exercises the former also exercises the latter. CBC is a novel integration-level coverage criterion, measuring the degree to which a test suite exercises the interactions between a caller and its callee classes. We implemented CLING and evaluated the approach on 140 pairs of classes from five different open-source Java projects. Our results show that (1) CLING generates test suites with high CBC coverage, thanks to the definition of the test suite generation as a many-objectives problem where each couple of branches is an independent objective; (2) such generated suites trigger different class interactions and can kill on average 7.7% (with a maximum of 50%) of mutants that are not detected by tests generated randomly or at the unit level; (3) CLING can detect integration faults coming from wrong assumptions about the usage of the callee class (25 for our subject systems) that remain undetected when using automatically generated random and unit-level test suites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guess What: Test Case Generation for Javascript with Unsupervised Probabilistic Type Inference</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/ssbse2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search-based test case generation approaches make use of static type information to determine which data types should be used for the creation of new test cases. Dynamically typed languages like JavaScript, however, do not have this type information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic type inference approach to infer data types within the test case generation process. We evaluated the proposed approach on a benchmark of 98~units under test (i.e., exported classes and functions) compared to random type sampling w.r.t. branch coverage. Our results show that our type inference approach achieves a statistically significant increase in 56% of the test files with up to 71% of branch coverage compared to the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hybrid Multi-level Crossover for Unit Test Case Generation</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art search-based approaches for test case generation work at test case level, where tests are represented as sequences of statements. These approaches make use of genetic operators (i.e., mutation and crossover) that create test variants by adding, altering, and removing statements from existing tests. While this encoding schema has been shown to be very effective for many-objective test case generation, the standard crossover operator (single-point) only alters the structure of the test cases but not the input data. In this paper, we argue that changing both the test case structure and the input data is necessary to increase the genetic variation and improve the search process. Hence, we propose a hybrid multi-level crossover (HMX) operator that combines the traditional test-level crossover with data-level recombination. The former evolves and alters the test case structures, while the latter evolves the input data using numeric and string-based recombinational operators. We evaluate our new crossover operator by performing an empirical study on more than 100 classes selected from open-source Java libraries for numerical operations and string manipulation. We compare HMX with the single-point crossover that is used in EvoSuite w.r.t structural coverage and fault detection capability. Our results show that HMX achieves a statistically significant increase in 30% of the classes up to 19% in structural coverage compared to the single-point crossover. Moreover, the fault detection capability improved up to 12% measured using strong mutation score.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-objective Test Case Selection Through Linkage Learning-driven Crossover</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test case selection (TCS) aims to select a subset of the test suite to run for regression testing. The selection is typically based on past coverage and execution cost data. Researchers have successfully used multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), such as NSGA-II and its variants, to solve the problem. These MOEAs use traditional crossovers to create new candidate solutions during the search. Recent studies in evolutionary computation showed that more effective recombinations can be made by using linkage learning. Inspired by these recent advances in this field, we propose a new variant of NSGA-II, called L2-NSGA, that uses linkage learning to optimize test case selection. In particular, we use an unsupervised clustering algorithm to infer promising patterns among the solutions (sub-test suites). Then, these patterns are used in the next iterations of L2-NSGA to create solutions that contain/preserve these inferred patterns. Our results show that our customizations make NSGA-II more effective for test case selection. Furthermore, the test suite sub-sets generated by L2-NSGA are less expensive and more effective (detect more faults) than those generated by MOEAs used in the literature for regression testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oracle Issues in Machine Learning and Where to Find Them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
The rise in popularity of machine learning (ML), and deep learning in particular, has both led to optimism about achievements of artificial intelligence, as well as concerns about possible weaknesses and vulnerabilities of ML pipelines. Within the software engineering community, this has led to a considerable body of work on ML testing techniques, including white- and black-box testing for ML models. This means the oracle problem needs to be addressed; for supervised ML applications, oracle information is indeed available in the form of dataset &amp;ldquo;ground truth&amp;rdquo;, that encodes input data with corresponding desired output labels. However, while ground truth forms a gold standard, there still is no guarantee it is truly correct. Indeed, syntactic, semantic, and conceptual framing issues in the oracle may negatively affect the ML system integrity. While syntactic issues may be automatically verified and corrected, the higher-level issues traditionally need human judgment and manual analysis.
In this paper, we employ two heuristics based on information entropy and semantic analysis on well-known computer vision models and benchmark data from ImageNet. The heuristics are used to semi-automatically uncover potential higher-level issues in (i) the label taxonomy used to define the ground truth oracle (labels), and (ii) data encoding and representation. In doing this, beyond existing ML testing efforts, we illustrate the need for SE strategies that especially target and assess the oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing with Fewer Resources: An Adaptive Approach to Performance-Aware Test Case Generation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/ieee-tse2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 09:51:33 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Automated test case generation is an effective technique to yield high-coverage test suites.
While the majority of research effort has been devoted to satisfying coverage criteria, a recent trend emerged towards optimizing other non-coverage aspects.
In this regard, runtime and memory usage are two essential dimensions: less expensive tests reduce the resource demands for the generation process and later regression testing phases.
This study shows that performance-aware test case generation requires solving two main challenges:
providing a good approximation of resource usage with minimal overhead and&lt;br&gt;
avoiding detrimental effects on both final coverage and fault detection effectiveness.
To tackle these challenges, we conceived a set of performance proxies -inspired by previous work on performance testing- that provide a reasonable estimation of the test execution costs (i.e., runtime and memory usage).
Thus, we propose an adaptive strategy, called aDynaMOSA, which leverages these proxies by extending DynaMOSA, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm in unit testing.
Our empirical study -involving 110 non-trivial Java classes- reveals
that our adaptive approach generates test suite with statistically significant improvements in runtime (-25%) and heap memory consumption (-15%) compared to DynaMOSA. Additionally, aDynaMOSA has comparable results to DynaMOSA over seven different coverage criteria and similar fault detection effectiveness.
Our empirical investigation also highlights that the usage of performance proxies (i.e., without the adaptiveness) is not sufficient to generate more performant test cases without compromising the overall coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effective and Efficient API Misuse Detection via Exception Propagation and Search-based Testing</title>
      <link>https://example.com/publication/issta2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 20:22:51 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/publication/issta2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Abstract &lt;/b&gt;: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
typically come with (implicit) usage constraints.
The violations of these constraints (API misuses)
can lead to software crashes.
Even though there are several tools that
can detect API misuses,
most of them suffer from a very high rate of false positives.
We introduce Catcher, a novel API misuse detection approach
that combines static exception propagation analysis with automatic search-based test case
generation to effectively and efficiently pinpoint crash-prone API misuses
in client applications.
We validate Catcher against 21 Java applications,
targeting misuses of the Java platform&amp;rsquo;s API.
Our results indicate that Catcher is able to generate
test cases that uncover 243 (unique) API misuses that result in
crashes.
Our empirical evaluation shows that Catcher can detect a large number of misuses (77 cases)
that would remain undetected by the traditional coverage-based test case generator EvoSuite.
Additionally, Catcher is on average eight times faster than EvoSuite
in generating test cases for the identified misuses.
Finally, we find that the majority of the exceptions triggered by Catcher
are unexpected to developers i.e., not only unhandled in the source code but also not listed in the documentation of the client applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used to support many software engineering tasks. Previous studies showed that default settings lead to sub-optimal topic modeling with a dramatic impact on the performance of such approaches in terms of precision and recall. For this reason, researchers used search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) to automatically configure topic models in an unsupervised fashion. While previous work showed the ability of individual search algorithms in finding near-optimal configurations, it is not clear to what extent the choice of the meta-heuristic matters for SE tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of five different meta-heuristics to configure LDA in the context of duplicate bug reports identification. The results show that (1) no master algorithm outperforms the others for all software projects, (2) random search and PSO are the least effective meta-heuristics. Finally, the running time strongly depends on the computational complexity of LDA while the internal complexity of the search algorithms plays a negligible role.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Multi-Objective Search Based Test Suite Optimization through Diversity Injection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
A way to reduce the cost of regression testing consists of selecting or prioritizing subsets of test cases from a test suite according to some criteria. Besides greedy algorithms, cost cognizant additional greedy algorithms, multi-objective optimization algorithms, and multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs), have also been proposed to tackle this problem. However, previous studies have shown that there is no clear winner between greedy and MOGAs, and that their combination does not necessarily produce better results. In this paper we show that the optimality of MOGAs can be significantly improved by diversifying the solutions (sub-sets of the test suite) generated during the search process. Specifically, we introduce a new MOGA, coined as DIversity based Genetic Algorithm (DIV-GA), based on the mechanisms of orthogonal design and orthogonal evolution that increase diversity by injecting new orthogonal individuals during the search process. Results of an empirical study conducted on eleven programs show that DIV-GA outperforms both greedy algorithms and the traditional MOGAs from the optimality point of view. Moreover, the solutions (sub-sets of the test suite) provided by DIV-GA are able to detect more faults than the other algorithms, while keeping the same test execution cost.&lt;/p&gt;
